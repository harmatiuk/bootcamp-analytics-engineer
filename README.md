# Bootcamp Analytics Engineer

This repository is for the Analytics Engineer bootcamp. The idea of this bootcamp is create a data warehouse layer with DBT and Google BigQuery.

## Introduction of database Northwind Traders (OLTP)

The Northwind database is a sample database created by Microsoft. The database contains all sales data from Northwind Traders, a fictitious specialty food export and import company. The Northwind database is an excellent tutorial schema for a small-business ERP, with customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, employees, and single-entry accounting. For this bootcamp I used a MySQL version of the Northwind sample database which can accessed with this link: http://github.com/dalers/mywind
